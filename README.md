# Media
> ### Repository used to host and hot link media on the web

Hopefully this isn't breaking GitHub's TOS. If anything, [they've sort of addressed it and left it ambiguous](https://github.community/t/uploading-an-image-to-a-github-repo-to-hotlink-from-a-site/1889). Let's see how this plays out and if the repo gets taken down.

Honestly, this would be the best media hosting site by a long shot since there's so many ways to organize your media.

## How the media is organized

I've created a branch for each type of media.

- images
- audio
- video
- mixed

The **default branch** is `about` and will host this README file and keep the other branches clear. Pretty neat huh?

## Example: Hot Linking an Image

Here I'll run through the process of embedding an image on a website.

1. Open the Repository either in the client or on GitHub
2. Switch to the appropriate branch for the file type you're adding.
3. Add the image to the repo then commit and push it.
